# **About Me**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a Unity developer with a strong love for making fun and engaging games. I enjoy bringing ideas to life, experimenting with gameplay, and constantly improving my skills. Iâ€™ve worked on both commercial projects (solo/team) and personal prototypes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to follow best practices and enjoy using design patterns like Object Pooling, Factory, Event Bus and more. I use dependency injection tools like Zenject and VContainer for scalable architectures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Let's make something amazing together! Check out my projects below, and feel free to connect with me.**

### [Gameplay Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjABlgw_PsNDuvBpDcE3SWbWRwyGWSjM/view?usp=drive_link)

- **Platform**: *Android* <br>
- **Description**: *This is a pet project through which I explored and learned many new and interesting things. The game was developed entirely on my own from scratch (except for the models and sprites).* <br>
- **Game features**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The game supports Google sign-in with Firebase and saves player progress in Firestore. It also includes ads mediation with Unity LevelPlay, integrating AdMob and Unity Ads with three ad formats: banners, rewarded ads (shown after death), and interstitials (displayed after every second win).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gameplay side, zombies spawn randomly across the map, so every level feels different. Thereâ€™s also a car explosion effect when the player dies, optimized by recording a custom animation in Unity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project follows SOLID and OOP principles, uses Zenject for dependency injection, and applies design patterns like Object Pooling (for zombies, bullets, and effects) and an Event Bus (for game state management).*
