# **About Me**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a Unity developer with a strong love for making fun and engaging games. I enjoy bringing ideas to life, experimenting with gameplay, and constantly improving my skills. I‚Äôve worked on both commercial projects (solo/team) and personal prototypes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to follow best practices and enjoy using design patterns like Object Pooling, Factory, Event Bus and more. I use dependency injection tools like Zenject and VContainer for scalable architectures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Let's make something amazing together! Check out my projects below, and feel free to connect with me.**

### [Gameplay Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjABlgw_PsNDuvBpDcE3SWbWRwyGWSjM/view?usp=drive_link)

- **Platform**: *Android* <br>
- **Description**: *This is a pet project through which I explored and learned many new and interesting things. The game was developed entirely on my own from scratch (except for the models and sprites).* <br>
- **Game features**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The game supports Google sign-in with Firebase and saves player progress in Firestore. It also includes ads mediation with Unity LevelPlay, integrating AdMob and Unity Ads with three ad formats: banners, rewarded ads (shown after death), and interstitials (displayed after every second win).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gameplay side, zombies spawn randomly across the map, so every level feels different. There‚Äôs also a car explosion effect when the player dies, optimized by recording a custom animation in Unity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project follows SOLID and OOP principles, uses Zenject for dependency injection, and applies design patterns like Object Pooling (for zombies, bullets, and effects) and an Event Bus (for game state management).*

### [Gameplay Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nlU626D5JFrWtzhQ3TQA1muRaSkABx6R/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Platform**: *IOS* <br>
- **Description**: *I made this game from scratch, starting with the first idea and bringing it to this version. (The sprites were drawn by an artist)* <br>
- **Game features**: *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stick&Shoot is a fast-paced game where precision matters. Built with Unity, C#, and clean code principles, the game uses Factory Pattern, DoTween for smooth animations, and Bootstrap for object initialization.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game features an in-game shop, a level selection menu, and music and sound controls. It includes a start screen and multiple playable levels. Progress is saved via JSON. Also you can use two fingers to accelerate the ball, collect gold stars to unlock unique skins (some of which have special abilities, like shields and coin multipliers), etc.*

### [Gameplay Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CXkTK-qzfqh_Iki0vkUgF7_KATEP1NmV/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Platform**: *Android* <br>
- **Description**: *This was one of the games I created for a client. I handled every part of the development myself ‚Äî from gameplay and design to implementation ‚Äî except for the 3D models (and their animations), sprites, and music.* <br>
- **Game features**: *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It‚Äôs a casual tower capture game inspired by Tower War on PlayMarket. The player can upgrade three main stats: the speed of spawning soldiers, the rate of their production, and the initial number of soldiers. The game includes five stages of enemy towers with increasing difficulty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bot opponent makes its own decisions by attacking the nearest enemy or neutral tower. The project also features a simple progress saving system, and I used DoTween to make the UI smooth and dynamic.*

### [Gameplay Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMoSLksH1-ZuVFXU0YWuOCfz5DDa-_zS/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Platform**: *IOS* <br>
- **Description**: *This was one of the games I created for a client. I handled every part of the development myself, from gameplay and design to implementation, except for the sprites and music.* <br>
- **Game features**: *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game features in-app purchases and offers four different types of upgrades for the player. The maps are generated dynamically using a variety of prefabs, which makes each level feel a bit different. Almost all of the sprites were created with the help of AI, giving the game a unique and consistent visual style.*
<br> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maps also include shields that the player can pick up to protect their ball from a single hit with an obstacle.*
